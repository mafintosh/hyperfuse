# hyperfuse

[Hyperfused](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperfused) client for node.

```
npm install hyperfuse
```

More docs will be added when this matures a bit more.

For now install try installing [hyperfused](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperfused) on your machine
and run the example.

That should spawn the fuse daemon and forward the fuse calls over stdin/stdout to the node process.
The node process will mirror `./mnt` to `./tmp` in the current working directory.
